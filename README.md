How It Works
============

Promo Drive Active clients notify each other when a player using it plays a promo blink
This information is provided anonymously to one another

Can SomerBlink ban me for using this?
=====================================

Technically, yes. But good luck detecting people using it!
Chrome runs its extensions in a sandbox, webpages cannot detect which plugins you have installed

Help! I'm not seeing any Promos!
================================

The plugin relies on  other people with the plugin playing promos
If no one plays on it, no one will be alerted.
Solution: share it with your friends!
